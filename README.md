### Introduction:

*Greetings. I'm a graduate student at Duke University in the Master of Interdisciplinary Data Science Program (MIDS). MIDS is a phenomenal program, and I'm fortunate to be a part of it - you should check it out at [this link.](https://datascience.duke.edu)*

*I left a little sketch to explain my career below. Here's a link to my [LinkedIn Profile ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-kroening/)if you'd like to know a little more. I'm in the Army, and I do data science. It's a bit newer for me in the last few years. Below the 'current projects' section, I left two sketches that explain a little bit of the work I've done in the past.*

*I've recently begun building a Hugging Face profile with a few fun projects. [Check it out here.](https://huggingface.co/andrewkroening)*

### Current projects:

#### IDS 706 (Data Engineering Systems)

* [Andrew's MIDS Videos](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTjQCZdGj6ozplSpZMqWndHNAmnto5Gyv) is the YouTube playlist of the demo videos I made for this course.

* [Automated Hugging Face Fine-Tuner](https://github.com/andrewkroening/hugging-face-gpt-trainer/tree/gpt-fine-tune) - A script for fine-tuning a conversational language model and pushing it back to the Hugging Face hub. Check out [this model](https://huggingface.co/andrewkroening/GalaxyFarAway-DialoGPT-HanSolo) to see it fine-tuned on Han Solo!

* [ONWARD Streamlit App](https://github.com/andrewkroening/ONWARD-Streamlit-App) - a little project to synthesize weather and air traffic data to provide an indicator if a flight will be delayed.

* [NBA WAR Predictor](https://huggingface.co/spaces/andrewkroening/nba-war-predictor) - a Gradio interface built on a HuggingFace Space to show a selected basketball player's performance and give a projection for five years after. [GitHub code repo here.](https://github.com/andrewkroening/nba-war-predictor-tool)

* [Data Pipeline Example](https://github.com/andrewkroening/azure-pipeline-example) built in Azure to capture survey responses, transform the data, conduct sentiment analysis, and alert a user if there is a negative response.

#### IDS 702 (Data Modeling)

* [Team Project](https://github.com/andrewkroening/orange-modeling-project) - We examined the relationships between mutiple factors and life expectancy in countries around the world.

### Past Work

#### Analytics Ecosystem

*This project took an existing system for collecting performance data and modernized it by leveraging the Microsoft Azure Cloud. I was the lead (and only) architect, engineer, developer, and analyst on the project. In a year, I deployed 8 Power Apps, numerous supporting Power Automate Flows, a relational Power BI data model, and 2 Power BI Apps. The project replaced hundreds of hours of manual writing, typing, and interpreting, as well as one bespoke (and expensive) app with a secure, modern, and modular system that provides cutting-edge insights at a fraction of the cost.*

#### Data Pathways Modernization

*This was my first project. At an event, I noticed that everyone was scribbling feedback on pieces of paper and turning them in for someone else to read and type. I had just started a data team and needed something to do, so I took the survey and converted it to a Microsoft Form. That form had a support Power Flow that uploaded responses to Sharepoint lists (we didn't have much by way of licenses early on). Power BI would ingest the responses from the lists and provide simple analytics about each event. It took about two or three months and became a great tool to support investments into military family readiness programs.*
