### Introduction:

*Greetings. I'm a graduate student at Duke University in the Master of Interdisciplinary Data Science Program (MIDS). MIDS is a phenomenal program, and I'm fortunate to be a part of it - you should check it out at [this link.](https://datascience.duke.edu)*

*I left a little sketch to explain my career below. Here's a link to my [LinkedIn Profile ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-kroening/)if you'd like to know a little more. I'm in the Army, and I do data science. It's a bit newer for me in the last few years. Below the 'current projects' section, I left two sketches that explain a little bit of the work I've done in the past.*

*To get an idea of some of the projects I've done recently you can check out [my MIDS Videos](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTjQCZdGj6ozplSpZMqWndHNAmnto5Gyv). This is the YouTube playlist of the demo videos I made for a Data Enginering course. I also have a Hugging Face profile with a few fun projects. [Check it out here.](https://huggingface.co/andrewkroening)*

### Ongoing Projects

#### Side Hustles

* [Fun Money Tools](https://github.com/andrewkroening/fun-money-tools) - I think learning personal finance can be hard. I also think coding stuff is fun. So I'm putting together a little project to help answer some of life's thorniest money questions. It's called "Fun Money Tools" and you can find the interface on Streamlit [at this link.](https://funmoneytools.streamlit.app)

### Fall 2022 Duke MIDS projects:

#### Data Engineering Systems (IDS 706)

* [World Cup Match Predictor](https://github.com/andrewkroening/tons-of-fun) - A Totally Not Serious FIFA Outcome Prediction Tool for the 2022 World Cup, we call it TONS OF FUN. We stream in live Soccer Power Index rankings and predict the outcomes of matches for each day of the tournament. Also has a function for users to simulate any desired matchup. [Check out TONS OF FUN](https://tons-of-fun.streamlit.app)

* [Auto ML Energy Predictions](https://github.com/andrewkroening/energy-predictions) - A project to use available open source data from several streams to construct a prediction tool for energy consumption in the United States.

* [Automated Hugging Face Fine-Tuner](https://github.com/andrewkroening/hugging-face-gpt-trainer/tree/gpt-fine-tune) - A script for fine-tuning a conversational language model and pushing it back to the Hugging Face hub. Check out [this model](https://huggingface.co/andrewkroening/GalaxyFarAway-DialoGPT-HanSolo) to see it fine-tuned on Han Solo!

* [ONWARD Streamlit App](https://github.com/andrewkroening/ONWARD-Streamlit-App) - A little project to synthesize weather and air traffic data to provide an indicator if a flight will be delayed. [Check out the ONWARD App](https://onward.streamlit.app)

* [NBA WAR Predictor](https://github.com/andrewkroening/nba-war-predictor-tool) - A Gradio interface built on a HuggingFace Space to show a selected basketball player's performance and give a projection for five years after. [Check out the Gradio App.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/andrewkroening/nba-war-predictor)

* [Data Pipeline Example](https://github.com/andrewkroening/azure-pipeline-example) - Built in Azure to capture survey responses, transform the data, conduct sentiment analysis, and alert a user if there is a negative response.

#### Data Modeling Systems (IDS 702)

* [Global Life Expectancy and Related Factors](https://github.com/andrewkroening/orange-modeling-project) - A group project where we examine the relationships between mutiple factors and life expectancy in countries around the world. We also seek to infer the developmental status of a country from the same data.

#### Practicing Data Science (IDS 720)

* [Efficacy of Policy Actions on Opioids](https://github.com/MIDS-at-Duke/pds-2022-pds_orange) - A group project where we examine the effectiveness of state policies on prescription rates of opiods, and overdose deaths as a result. (In-progress)


### Past Work

#### Analytics Ecosystem

*This project took an existing system for collecting performance data and modernized it by leveraging the Microsoft Azure Cloud. I was the lead (and only) architect, engineer, developer, and analyst on the project. In a year, I deployed 8 Power Apps, numerous supporting Power Automate Flows, a relational Power BI data model, and 2 Power BI Apps. The project replaced hundreds of hours of manual writing, typing, and interpreting, as well as one bespoke (and expensive) app with a secure, modern, and modular system that provides cutting-edge insights at a fraction of the cost.*

#### Data Pathways Modernization

*This was my first project. At an event, I noticed that everyone was scribbling feedback on pieces of paper and turning them in for someone else to read and type. I had just started a data team and needed something to do, so I took the survey and converted it to a Microsoft Form. That form had a support Power Flow that uploaded responses to Sharepoint lists (we didn't have much by way of licenses early on). Power BI would ingest the responses from the lists and provide simple analytics about each event. It took about two or three months and became a great tool to support investments into military family readiness programs.*
