### Introduction:

*Greetings. I'm a graduate student at Duke University in the [Master of Interdisciplinary Data Science Program (MIDS).](https://datascience.duke.edu)*

*I left a little sketch to explain my career below. Here's a link to my [LinkedIn Profile ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-kroening/)if you'd like to know a little more. The punchline is I'm in the Army, and I do data science. Here's what you can find on this page:*

- *[Current Projects:](#current-projects) where I highlight a few things I'm currently working on*
- *[Duke MIDS Class Projects:](#duke-mids-class-projects) where I showcase some of the highlights from my coursework at Duke*
- *[Past Work:](#past-work) where I left a couple of sketches to explain some previous projects I've been involved in*

*I also have a Hugging Face profile with a few fun projects. [Check it out here.](https://huggingface.co/andrewkroening)*

### Current Projects

#### Side Hustles

* [Fun Money Tools](https://github.com/andrewkroening/fun-money-tools) - I think learning personal finance can be hard. I also think coding stuff is fun. So I'm putting together a little project to help answer some of life's thorniest money questions. It's called "Fun Money Tools," and you can find the interface on Streamlit [at this link.](https://funmoneytools.streamlit.app)

* [Precious Metal Analysis](https://github.com/andrewkroening/precious-metal-price-analysis) - This is a project that I'm doing to practice the sequence from exploratory data analysis through model fitting and selection and into deployment. In particular, I'm looking at ways to predict the spot price of silver, given the price of other variables. I'm unsure what form this will take in the end, but it should be fun. Stay posted for future updates!

* [The DATAS](https://github.com/andrewkroening/the-datas) - The Data Analysis Tools for Analysis and Stuff is a little Python Poetry package I'm putting together to take some of my favorite, bespoke functions and put them together in one place. Stay tuned; this one is early in development. And yes, to use it, you'll have to type "the-datas" at least once.

### Duke MIDS Class Projects

#### Causal Inference (IDS 701)

* [Analyzing the Impact of Reporting Periods on Law Enforcement Officer Behavior](https://github.com/MIDS-at-Duke/unifying-data-science-2023-project-team7) - This project examines whether local law enforcement officers increase ticketing activity in response to financial incentives or pressures as a reporting deadline approaches. Basically, is it true when Grandma said, "The officers give more tickets at the end of the month?"

#### Data Engineering Systems (IDS 706)

*You can check out [my MIDS Videos](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTjQCZdGj6ozplSpZMqWndHNAmnto5Gyv) to see the YouTube playlist of the demo videos I made for this course.*

* [World Cup Match Predictor](https://github.com/andrewkroening/tons-of-fun) - A Totally Not Serious FIFA Outcome Prediction Tool for the 2022 World Cup, we call it TONS OF FUN. We streamed live Soccer Power Index rankings and predicted the outcomes of matches for each day of the tournament. Also has a function for users to simulate any desired matchup. [Check out TONS OF FUN.](https://tons-of-fun.streamlit.app)

* [Auto ML Energy Predictions](https://github.com/andrewkroening/energy-predictions) - A project to use available open-source data from several streams to construct a prediction tool for energy consumption in the United States.

* [Automated Hugging Face Fine-Tuner](https://github.com/andrewkroening/hugging-face-gpt-trainer/tree/gpt-fine-tune) - A script for fine-tuning a conversational language model and pushing it back to the Hugging Face hub. Check out [this model](https://huggingface.co/andrewkroening/GalaxyFarAway-DialoGPT-HanSolo) to see it fine-tuned on Han Solo!

* [ONWARD Streamlit App](https://github.com/andrewkroening/ONWARD-Streamlit-App) - A little project to synthesize weather and air traffic data to provide an indicator if a flight will be delayed. [Check out the ONWARD App](https://onward.streamlit.app)

* [NBA WAR Predictor](https://github.com/andrewkroening/nba-war-predictor-tool) - A Gradio interface built on a HuggingFace Space to show a selected basketball player's performance and give a projection for five years after. [Check out the Gradio App.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/andrewkroening/nba-war-predictor)

* [Data Pipeline Example](https://github.com/andrewkroening/azure-pipeline-example) - Built in Azure to capture survey responses, transform the data, conduct sentiment analysis, and alert a user if there is a negative response.

#### Data Modeling Systems (IDS 702)

* [Global Life Expectancy and Related Factors](https://github.com/andrewkroening/orange-modeling-project) - A group project examining the relationships between multiple factors and life expectancy in countries worldwide. We also seek to infer the developmental status of a country from the same data.

#### Practicing Data Science (IDS 720)

* [Efficacy of Policy Actions on Opioids](https://github.com/MIDS-at-Duke/pds-2022-pds_orange) - A group project where we examine the effectiveness of state policies on prescription rates of opioids and overdose deaths as a result.


### Past Work

#### Analytics Ecosystem

*This project took an existing system for collecting performance data and modernized it by leveraging the Microsoft Azure Cloud. I was the lead (and only) architect, engineer, developer, and analyst on the project. In a year, I deployed 8 Power Apps, numerous supporting Power Automate Flows, a relational Power BI data model, and 2 Power BI Apps. The project replaced hundreds of hours of manual writing, typing, interpreting, and one bespoke (and expensive) app with a secure, modern, and modular system that provides cutting-edge insights at a fraction of the cost.*

#### Data Pathways Modernization

*This was my first project. At an event, I noticed that everyone was scribbling feedback on pieces of paper and turning them in for someone else to read and type. I had just started a data team and needed something to do, so I took the survey and converted it to a Microsoft Form. That form had a support Power Flow that uploaded responses to Sharepoint lists (we didn't have much by way of licenses early on). Power BI would ingest the responses from the lists and provide simple analytics about each event. It took about two or three months and became a great tool to support investments in military family readiness programs.*
