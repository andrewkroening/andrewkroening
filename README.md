### Introduction

Hey there! I'm Andrew and I'm a Data Scientist, Innovator, and General Problem-Solver. Recently, I graduated from Duke University with a 

- *[Master of Interdisciplinary Data Science (MIDS) Degree](https://datascience.duke.edu)*
- *[Innovation and Entreprenuership (I&E) Graduate Certificate](https://entrepreneurship.duke.edu)*

I am back out in the field now. Below, you’ll find a sketch of my career journey and links to  and projects that highlight my work:

### Current Projects

#### Side Hustles

* ![Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/Beta-orange.svg) [Fun Money Tools](https://github.com/andrewkroening/fun-money-tools) - I believe learning personal finance should be accessible and fun, so I’m creating “Fun Money Tools,” a project to answer life’s tricky money questions. Check out the [Streamlit app here.](https://funmoneytools.streamlit.app)

* ![In Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/In%20Dev-yellow.svg) [Precious Metal Analysis](https://github.com/andrewkroening/precious-metal-price-analysis) - Practicing data analysis from EDA to deployment by predicting silver spot prices based on other variables. Still figuring out the end game, so stay tuned!

Here’s an enhanced version of the Research and Engineering Work section with more detailed descriptions for each project:

### Research and Engineering Work

*These projects are a sample from my work at Duke and beyond:*

#### Research Highlights

* **[Recruiting Data Analysis](https://github.com/andrewkroening/recruiting-analysis):** Analyzed 30,000+ recruitment records to uncover systemic issues and bottlenecks in the recruitment process. Provided actionable recommendations to stakeholders, including strategies to improve data validity, optimize application tracking, and increase submission rates.

* **[Law Enforcement Behavior and Reporting Periods](https://github.com/MIDS-at-Duke/unifying-data-science-2023-project-team7):** Explored the hypothesis that law enforcement ticketing patterns may change as reporting deadlines approach, driven by financial incentives. Analyzed extensive data sets to provide evidence-based conclusions on behavioral changes tied to fiscal periods.

* **[Efficacy of Policy Actions on Opioids](https://github.com/MIDS-at-Duke/pds-2022-pds_orange):** Examined the effectiveness of state policies on opioid prescriptions and overdose rates using data-driven techniques. The project aimed to quantify policy impacts and provided recommendations for public health improvements and legislative adjustments.

* **[Global Life Expectancy Factors](https://github.com/andrewkroening/orange-modeling-project):** Investigated global life expectancy trends by analyzing various socio-economic and environmental factors. Developed models to infer a country’s development status and provided insights into policy implications for health and welfare improvements.

#### Engineering Highlights

* **[Aviation Network Visualization](https://github.com/andrewkroening/airport-network-viz):** Created an interactive tool to visualize airline networks using NetworkX. This app allows users to explore flight routes, analyze network connectivity, and draw insights into global aviation patterns through [Streamlit](https://airport-networks.streamlit.app).

* **[ONWARD App](https://github.com/andrewkroening/ONWARD-Streamlit-App):** Designed an app that integrates weather and air traffic data to predict flight delays. The app provides a real-time interface for travelers to make more informed decisions about their journeys. [Check it out.](https://onward.streamlit.app)

* **[World Cup Match Predictor](https://github.com/andrewkroening/world-cup-match-predict):** Developed a live prediction tool for the 2022 World Cup, using the Soccer Power Index to simulate and predict match outcomes. This tool allows users to simulate matches and explore different scenarios. [Try it here.](https://tons-of-fun.streamlit.app)
